# USGS
Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the United States Geological Survey, or USGS data set based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes  appear larger and darker in color.

The popup shows the date nd time the earthquake occured and the place.
